# Risk-Analysis
Risk analytics is a collection of approaches that accurately monitors, quantifies, and 
anticipates risk. Risk management is not a new concept; it has been a primary duty 
of management for many years. Risk consciousness has recently grown. Breach 
reports, inadequate protocols, data hacking, and faulty systems are all common topics 
in the media. The regulatory and economic contexts are becoming more stringent, 
and risk management is more vital than ever. Data Science calculates risk probability 
and impact assessment of the risk, and also the cost to business.
In this task we are given dataset (in rar file). We need to help company for preventing risk.
